# Keks-menu
	Kek's menu is a 2take1 lua script that's focused on utilities and trolling.
	The feature list will be structured like the script is.
	If there's anything confusing or vague in the feature list, feel free to suggest improvements.

## General settings

### Script loader

### Hotkeys

#### Notifications
	Toggle whether to show a notification whenever a hotkey is pressed

#### Hotkey mode
	Before setting hotkeys, make sure you have set the right hotkey mode.
	If it's set to keyboard, it looks for keyboard input. If it's set to controller, it looks for controller input.
	This means that setting the wrong input mode before setting hotkeys will lead to unpredictable behaviour.

#### Setting hotkeys
	A hotkey can be bound to 1 - 3 keys.
	The script uses gta 5's input system, so some keys can't be set as hotkeys.

#### Keys that can be set as hotkeys
	A-Y (WITH EXCEPTION OF i, j and o)
	Up, Down, Left, Right
	f1 - f11 (f4 is not supported)
