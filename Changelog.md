## **Improvements**

> Anti chat spoof
> Modded name detection

> "Shoot entity| get model name of entity", getting ped instead of vehicle
> Vehicle gun error if you have no personal vehicle
> Chatbot & chat judger integrity checker being absurdly slow, causing seconds of freezing
> Give car godmode stopping the player's vehicle
> Menyoo map-> "Set where you spawn" not working on maps saved by the script
> Menyoo/ini spawners setting rotations wrong
> Fixed 30k loop
